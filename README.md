# examples of training models in pytorch

Some implementations of Deep Learning algorithms in PyTorch.

## Ranking

* RankNet
Feed forward NN, minimize document pairwise cross entropy loss function

* LambdaRank
Feed forward NN. Gradient is proportional to NDCG change of swapping two pairs of document

## Dependencies:
pytorch-1.0
